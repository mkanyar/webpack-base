# webpack-base

This is the base StackBlitz project for other webpack-related demos.
It has `webpack`, `webpack-cli` and `http-server` installed.

You can also debug webpack in the browser, I made a video about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s-t3uECOic&t=2s).

## Running webpack

```bash
npm run build
```

## Opening in the browser

By default, it looks into the `./dist` directory.

```bash
npm start
```
